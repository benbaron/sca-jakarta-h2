# SCA Bookkeeping Program — Codex Execution Plan

## 1. Purpose

This document is the phase controller for Codex work in `benbaron/sca-jakarta-h2`. Codex must select one phase and one slice using `AGENTS.md`, execute only that scope, and update this file with actual state.

This revision records P05-C5 as DONE through PR #148 and advances P03-C4 to VERIFYING. P03-C4 is the Transaction Editor and Journal Pane redesign, using `benbaron/NonprofitAccounting` `src/main/java/nonprofitbookkeeping/ui` only as a design reference.

## 2. Status values

- `BLOCKED`
- `READY`
- `IN_PROGRESS`
- `VERIFYING`
- `DONE`
- `ELIMINATED`

Only merged and verified behavior is `DONE`. `ELIMINATED` means the former phase or function is no longer part of the product plan and must not be reintroduced without a new requirements decision.

## 3. Phase index after requirements clarification

## 4. Governing documents

Always read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `doc/PLAN.md`

Focused documents for current UI/accounting work:

- `doc/interface-operation-matrix.md`
- `doc/persistence-authority-inventory.md`
- `doc/ui_design_rules.md`
- `doc/ui/editor-guidelines.md`
- `doc/requirements/requirements-clarification-overlay.md`
- `doc/inventory/inventory-and-assets.md`
- `doc/accounting/ledger-authority.md`
- `doc/accounting/transaction-lifecycle.md`
- `doc/accounting/period-and-correction-policy.md`
- `doc/accounting/transaction-editor-and-journal.md`
- `doc/workflow/development-workflow.md`

`doc/architecture/production-workspace.md` was removed. Do not re-add it or list it as required reading.

## 5. Established product decisions after clarification

- One production JavaFX application.
- H2 is authoritative for accepted operational/accounting data.
- Existing JPA/Hibernate model and Flyway migrations are the schema foundation.
- No parallel ledgers, budget stores, import stores, or panel frameworks.
- Write services own validation and transactions.
- Query services return projections for panels and reports.
- Constructor injection is preferred.
- Left Navigation under Accounting must include Banking and Inspect Journal.
- Left Navigation must not include Schedules.
- Left Navigation must not include Import/Export Jobs as a separate function.
- No approval queue or formal approval/rejection workflow.
- Reconciliation approve/reject semantics are replaced by saved comparison/reconciliation state.
- Notes and factual audit history are in scope.
- Reports belong in `REPORT_LIBRARY`.
- The former Schedules function is eliminated.
- Import/Export Jobs is eliminated as both a panel and generic durable job-tracking function.
- Fixed assets are distinct from inventory and require H2-backed asset/depreciation records.
- Inventory/supplies are distinct from fixed assets and require H2-backed item/movement records.
- Production widgets with visible non-blank display text should expose their full text on hover, except text boxes and custom-help tooltip cases.
- Disabled placeholder Delete buttons are not part of the UI contract; a Delete button must perform a real supported operation.
- Bank Reconciliation must become a full statement-to-ledger matching workspace, not only a saved comparison table.
- Transaction supplemental schedule/detail panels are not the eliminated generic Schedules function; they are per-transaction detail editors and viewers.

## 6. Completed phases and slices

### P00 — Documentation and implementation inventory

Status: DONE, with clarification updates as touched.

### P01 — Production shell and workspace composition

Status: DONE, retrofit as touched.

Corrective slices:

- P01-C1 Full-text hover tooltips for production widgets: DONE through PR #141.

### P02 — Canonical ledger and transaction operations

Status: DONE, retain.

### P03 — Transaction Editor, Ledger Register, and Journal Pane

Status: READY; corrective P03-C4 VERIFYING.

Completed slices:

- P03-C1 Transaction Editor modes and Ledger Register buttons: DONE.
- P03-C2 Journal Pane and Inspect Journal navigation: DONE.
- P03-C3 Transaction Editor Delete correction action: DONE.

### P03-C4 — Transaction Editor and Journal Pane redesign

Status: VERIFYING.
Branch: `codex/P03-C4-transaction-editor-table-state-plan`
Pull request: #149
Head: `dddfa92d52580970296c785f1333b2853ed843c7`

Purpose: redesign the Transaction Editor and Journal Pane for usable, laptop-width transaction entry and review, using the legacy `benbaron/NonprofitAccounting` JavaFX UI package only as a design reference.

Implemented in branch:

- `TransactionEditorPanel` is reorganized into task-sized tabs: Header, Entry Lines, Additional Details, Donation Subschedule, and Supplemental Details.
- Header tab includes journal-entry title, date, memo, debit total, credit total, difference, balanced/needs-attention status, and validation text.
- Entry Lines tab includes the editable entry-line table, Add Line, Duplicate, Remove, one-sided Debit/Credit behavior, blank row behavior, and active-company table-state persistence.
- Additional Details tab groups Party / Document, Bank / Reconciliation, and Budget / Fund details.
- Donation Subschedule tab exposes donation ID, donor ID, donor name, and a disabled donor-edit action with a clear explanation because no H2 donor editing service is in this slice.
- Supplemental Details tab exposes Receivable, Payable, Prepaid Expense, Deferred Revenue, Other Asset, and Other Liability panels as transaction-local detail panels. Unsupported Add/Remove actions are disabled with explanatory tooltips.
- `JournalPane` now groups journal projections into transaction-level rows with Date, Account Title and Description, Fund, Cleared, Debit, Credit, Transaction ID, Supplemental, and Memo/Details regions.
- Journal Pane adds New, Edit, Delete, and Refresh actions. Delete routes through the current correction policy and `TransactionCorrectionService` rather than deleting table rows.
- `TransactionEditorRedesignSourceTest` and updated `JournalPaneTest` guard the redesign structure, grouped-journal behavior, table-state wiring, and absence of reintroduced generic Schedules navigation/class usage.
- `doc/interface-operation-matrix.md` and `doc/ui/editor-guidelines.md` are updated for the new Transaction Editor and Journal Pane behavior.

Validation so far:

- Maven PR Tests run 29039185959 completed successfully for head `50fdab8d52ca7a8e61f28a33b8a0cb8c19a57c24`.
- Maven PR Tests run 29039394914 completed successfully for head `dddfa92d52580970296c785f1333b2853ed843c7` after the editor-guidelines documentation update.

Remaining deliverable before DONE:

- Desktop visual validation of Transaction Editor and Journal Pane at laptop width.

## 7. Active and recent phase contracts

# P06 — Bank reconciliation and cleared-state comparison

**Selector:** `PHASE=P06`
**Status:** DONE through PR #138; corrective P06-C1 DONE through PR #146; corrective P06-C2 DONE through PR #147
**Depends on:** P05

Completed deliverables: removed approval semantics; added configured-account reconciliation comparison; added unresolved report summaries backed by H2 run records.

### P06-C1 — Full Bank Reconciliation workspace

Status: DONE through PR #146.

Completed deliverables: V57 H2 tables for durable reconciliation sessions and match/resolution rows; `BankReconciliationWorkspaceService`; configured-account filtering; session start/load/list; balance calculations; manual statement-line entry; CSV/OFX/QIF import parsing; matching, unmatching, mark-cleared, resolve-difference, save-unresolved, and finalize; JavaFX reconciliation workspace with configured-account selector, session controls, four cleared-state policies, balance cards, statement source tabs, matching tables, comparison report, and saved reconciliation table.

### P06-C2 — Bank Reconciliation laptop layout correction

Status: DONE through PR #147.

Completed deliverables: Replaced the one-page reconciliation canvas with workflow tabs: Setup, Statement, Match, and Review / Save; moved configured-account/session/policy controls to Setup; moved manual/CSV/OFX/QIF statement entry and import controls to Statement; moved statement and ledger tables plus match/unmatch/mark-cleared/resolve controls to Match; moved balance cards, comparison report, and save/finalize controls to Review / Save.

# P07 — Eliminated former Schedules phase

**Selector:** `PHASE=P07`
**Status:** DONE through PR #139

Completed deliverables: removed `SchedulesPanel`, production factory route, navigation item, schedule runbook sidecar methods, schedule runbook formatting tests, and related operation-matrix/persistence-inventory references. `AppPanelId.SCHEDULES` remains only as a retired compatibility enum value for legacy switch/preset paths; it has no product route.

# P08 — Asset Register and depreciation

**Selector:** `PHASE=P08`
**Status:** DONE through PR #140; corrective P08-C1 DONE through PR #144
**Depends on:** P02

Required behavior: implement Asset Register add/edit and depreciation behavior through H2-backed records and canonical accounting transactions. Assets are separate from Inventory items. Depreciation schedules define calculation only; running depreciation creates actual accounting transactions through the canonical transaction service.

Status: DONE through PR #140.

Completed deliverables: V55 fixed asset/depreciation-run migration; `FixedAsset` and `FixedAssetDepreciationRun` JPA entities; `FixedAssetService` create/update/list/depreciation-run behavior; depreciation runs create canonical `Txn` and `TxnSplit` rows; Asset Register and Depreciation Runs panels read/write through `FixedAssetService`; asset/depreciation runbook sidecars removed; docs and focused tests added/updated, including a Flyway migration-version uniqueness guardrail.

### P08-C1 — Asset Register selector display labels

Status: DONE through PR #144.

Completed deliverables: Added account and fund `StringConverter` display labels for Asset Register selectors so combo boxes show `code — name` instead of Java object identity strings; added focused source-level label-format test.

# P01-C1 — Full-text hover tooltips

**Selector:** `PHASE=P01`
**Status:** DONE through PR #141

Completed deliverables: `FullTextTooltipInstaller` utility; production `MainApp` installation; UI design-rule documentation; focused JavaFX tests.

# P09 — Inventory and supplies

**Selector:** `PHASE=P09`
**Status:** DONE through PR #142; corrective P09-C1 DONE through PR #143
**Depends on:** P02

Required behavior: implement genuine Inventory item add and movement history; remove runbook subpane; use canonical transactions when financially relevant.

### P09-S1 — H2 inventory items and movement history

Status: DONE through PR #142.

Completed deliverables: V56 inventory item/movement migration; `InventoryItem` and `InventoryMovement` JPA entities; `InventoryService` create/update/list/movement behavior; `InventoryPanel` reads/writes through `InventoryService`; inventory text runbook sidecar removed from `UiWorkspaceDataStore` and `RunbookPersistence`; focused service tests and docs added/updated.

# P10 — Period close, reopening, and factual audit history

**Selector:** `PHASE=P10`
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Depends on:** P02, P06

Required behavior: implement calculated period close/reopen while keeping factual Audit History and no approval/rejection workflow.

# P11 — Report Library

**Selector:** `PHASE=P11`
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Depends on:** P02, P04, P06, P08, P09, P10

# P12 — Administration, company lifecycle, preferences, and Funds edit

**Selector:** `PHASE=P12`
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Depends on:** P01, P02

# P13 — Data exchange and diagnostics without Import/Export Jobs

**Selector:** `PHASE=P13`
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Depends on:** P02, P05, P12

# P14 — End-to-end hardening

**Selector:** `PHASE=P14`
**Status:** BLOCKED
**Depends on:** P03-P13 except eliminated P07

## 8. Cross-cutting validation matrix

Every phase adds applicable tests:

- accounting invariants;
- validation;
- state transitions;
- service transaction rollback;
- in-memory H2 repositories;
- migrations;
- JavaFX layout and command routing;
- TestFX workflow checks where UI behavior is central;
- report/export smoke tests.
