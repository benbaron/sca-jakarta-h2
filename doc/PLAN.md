# SCA Bookkeeping Program — Codex Execution Plan

## 1. Purpose and source of truth

This document is the execution ledger for `benbaron/sca-jakarta-h2`. Execute one selected phase and slice at a time under root `AGENTS.md`. Current `main`, merged PRs, migrations, tests, governing documents, and this controller are authoritative over archived plans.

A slice is `DONE` only when its behavior/documentation is merged, required validation is green, governing documentation is current, and required owner acceptance is complete.

## 2. Current phase index

| Phase | Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P00-P04 | Inventory, shell, canonical ledger/Journal, budgeting | DONE |
| P05 | Banking configuration and statement import | DONE through P05-C8 / PR #289 |
| P06 | Bank reconciliation and cleared-state comparison | DONE |
| P07 | Former Schedules phase | ELIMINATED/DONE |
| P08-P10 | Assets/depreciation, Inventory, period close/audit | DONE for original contracts |
| P11 | Report Library | DONE through P11-C2 / PR #284; period-context correction P17-C9 DONE |
| P12-P15 | Administration, diagnostics/exchange, hardening, versioned interchange | DONE for original contracts |
| P16 | Interface-to-authority completion and integrity corrections | DONE through P16-C11 / PR #281 |
| P17 | Cross-cutting UI, authority, cleanup, durable-record, documentation corrections | DONE through P17-C12 / PR #305 |
| P18 | Depreciation-run workflow completion | DONE through P18-S1 / PR #306 |
| P19 | Deferred Company Administration extensions | DONE through P19-S3 / PR #309 |
| P20 | Authentication and runtime authorization | P20-S3 IN_PROGRESS |

## 3. Established product decisions

- One production JavaFX application and one H2 accounting/operational authority.
- Existing JPA/Hibernate model and nondestructive Flyway migrations remain the schema foundation.
- Write services own validation and transactions; query/orchestration services do not create parallel persistence.
- No parallel ledger, budget, import, record, preference, shell, session, reconciliation, period-close, depreciation, report, company, Chart of Accounts, identity, credential, or authorization authority.
- Every enabled production command performs a genuine operation or navigation.
- Durable records preserve meaningful history through governed lifecycle/correction semantics.
- Company-specific money/date/table/divider and other UI/workflow defaults remain H2-backed through the established company preference/state authority.
- EIN is optional informational company metadata. It is not tax-filing configuration and does not imply tax-return, jurisdiction, period, reporting, or export workflow.
- Compatibility identifiers/APIs remain only where a current compatibility path requires them.
- Historical/archive documents remain historical evidence; current governing documents describe current production authority.

### P20 adopted security decisions

- `AppUser` is the account/login identity; `AppRole` never stores a password.
- Authentication is local to the H2 database; no external IdP/SSO/MFA requirement is adopted.
- Reserved default accounts/roles are `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `ACCOUNTANT`, and `VIEWER`.
- Reserved accounts start with no password. A passwordless account can explicitly log in with no password challenge.
- Only ADMIN may set, replace, or clear account passwords, including its own.
- Each company starts with one default assignment for ADMIN, MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT, and VIEWER.
- There is exactly one effective ADMIN account in the database; no second account may obtain effective ADMIN authority.
- Default inactivity timeout is disabled. A session ends on explicit logout, application exit, or database switch unless an ADMIN later configures a nonzero timeout.
- ADMIN has full security/application authority; MANAGER has bookkeeping plus non-security company administration; ACCOUNTANT has normal bookkeeping write authority; VIEWER is read-only with report/export access.
- Authenticated user identity becomes the authoritative audit actor once P20 enforcement is implemented.
- Forgotten singleton-ADMIN credentials require an explicit offline local recovery that clears only the ADMIN credential to the passwordless state; no default/backdoor password is permitted.
- The local workstation/H2 file permissions are the outer trust boundary; application passwords do not claim protection against unrestricted OS/database-file access.

Governing requirements: `doc/P20-S1-authentication-authorization-boundary.md`.

## 4. Completed recent phases

P17 is DONE through P17-C12 / PR #305.

P18-S1 is DONE: PR #306 final head `d802cfdbb739978f09fa516ad09fde32a8fe92ff` passed Maven PR Tests run `33229276083`, job `99039021126`, and merged to `main` at `3dec9516f1bb785dfefb2b277372be7fed656871` after owner acceptance.

## 5. P19 — Deferred Company Administration extensions

### P19-S1 — Company Chart of Accounts assignment administration

Status: DONE.

PR #307 exact final head `75e2ab1a47e2fad95be460426ea64b038109842c` passed Maven PR Tests run `33231705169`, job `99045589148`, and merged after owner acceptance.

Completed behavior:

- `chart_of_accounts.company_id` remains chart ownership authority;
- `company.active_chart_of_accounts_id` remains the current-chart pointer;
- Company Admin lists only company-owned charts and deliberately selects the current chart;
- DRAFT selection promotes to ACTIVE, while RETIRED/cross-company selection is rejected;
- prior ACTIVE charts and all existing account/history relationships remain intact;
- no migration or second chart/assignment authority was introduced.

### P19-S2 — Company reporting-default administration

Status: DONE.

PR #308 exact final head `e1f45ee0b0f96870425f9f96d10e960e3c86d3c0` passed Maven PR Tests run `33264570758`, job `99132280957`, and merged to `main` at `b4ef30643978eb926e97773a13a6102b0389244a` after owner acceptance.

Completed behavior:

- current Report Library has exactly two safe company-level opening defaults with real consumers: initial report selection and initial export format;
- the values reuse existing H2 `company_ui_state` via `CompanyUiPreferencesService` under `reportingDefaults.`;
- missing or stale saved values fall back to Trial Balance/Text;
- a new Report Library reads the defaults once; changing Company Admin defaults never replaces an already-open operator selection;
- Report Library interaction does not automatically rewrite company defaults;
- report dates, fund, row limit, account, fixed-asset, inventory, and status filters remain transient/current-request parameters;
- no migration, report query/execution, or export-adapter behavior was introduced.

Governing design: `doc/P19-S2-company-reporting-defaults.md`.

### P19-S3 — Company EIN informational metadata

Status: DONE.

PR #309 exact final head `6849fd70d6c47a886f4eef9967c4b69a38e380b6` passed Maven PR Tests run `33273006267`, job `99154805470`: clean headless verification, repeat tests, and production JavaFX route compliance all succeeded. Owner acceptance was confirmed and PR #309 merged to `main` at `00d498705544e1a76d99b159f4b8fc23f80012a1`.

Completed behavior:

- nullable `company.ein VARCHAR(40)` is the sole live production EIN authority;
- V75 nondestructively backfills nonblank legacy `company_tax_profile.ein` while retaining legacy table/data;
- obsolete live `CompanyTaxProfile` JPA/query authority is retired;
- EIN is editable through the stable company profile lifecycle;
- no tax-filing, jurisdiction, filing-period, report, export, banking, or accounting workflow was introduced.

Governing design: `doc/P19-S3-company-ein-metadata.md`.

## 6. P20 — Authentication and runtime authorization

### P20-S1 — Authentication and authorization requirements boundary

Status: DONE.

PR #310 exact final head `17077c2c2ba68a7c152554bccde04f3bb2aaa6ce` passed Maven PR Tests run `33279457435`, job `99172041566`, and merged to `main` at `3d4f0d775e454e506ca4e20d7101eff613f47d0a` after owner acceptance.

Governing requirements: `doc/P20-S1-authentication-authorization-boundary.md`.

### P20-S2 — Authentication implementation

Status: DONE.

PR #311 exact final head `630d022584449298ad900ee00126f41eafe96917` passed Maven PR Tests run `33292407265`, job `99206247747`: clean headless verification, repeat tests, and production JavaFX route compliance all succeeded. Owner confirmed the tests and merged PR #311 to `main` at `40a4a37aaeed7fa94d847009d55a177f94b1d407`.

Completed behavior includes:

- H2-owned optional `AppUser` credentials; roles never own passwords;
- passwordless reserved ADMIN/MANAGER/ACCOUNTANT/VIEWER accounts and per-company assignments;
- singleton effective ADMIN and required ADMIN assignment protection;
- explicit login/logout and authenticated in-memory session identity;
- effective reserved roles derived from current company-scoped H2 assignments;
- company-switch role recomputation and no-access rejection;
- default inactivity timeout disabled, with ADMIN-controlled nonzero configuration;
- ADMIN password set/replace/clear including self;
- explicit offline ADMIN credential recovery;
- factual security events and real User Admin authentication controls.

### P20-S3 — Runtime authorization enforcement

Status: IN_PROGRESS.

Foundation PR #312 exact final head `db3a30289aa17b967948a79a048f9ebdf9c5042e` passed Maven PR Tests run `33293417227`, job `99208891671`, and merged to `main` at `1b11df7cdc98775c618e8489ca7608bde36ea547`.

Continuation branch: `codex/P20-S3-service-enforcement`
Starting base: merged `main` `1b11df7cdc98775c618e8489ca7608bde36ea547`
Pull request: pending

First continuation tranche:

- adds a nullable service adapter around the central `AuthorizationGuard` so legacy/test constructors remain source-compatible while guarded constructors fail closed;
- applies `BOOKKEEPING_WRITE` to Fund create/update/upsert/delete mutation boundaries;
- leaves Fund queries (`usage`) readable;
- adds H2-backed direct-service coverage proving VIEWER denial, immediate ACCOUNTANT enablement, immediate switch back to VIEWER denial, and wrong-company rejection without stale authorization state;
- does not yet wire the guard into the production `UiServiceRegistry`; that wiring is the next action after this focused service contract is green.

Required reading:

- `doc/P20-S1-authentication-authorization-boundary.md`;
- `doc/P20-S3-runtime-authorization.md`;
- `doc/administration/user-role-maintenance.md`;
- `doc/interface-operation-matrix.md`;
- `doc/ui_design_rules.md`;
- `doc/ui/editor-guidelines.md`.

Required inspection:

- `AuthenticatedUserSession`, `ReservedSecurityRole`, `AuthenticationService`, `SecurityAdminService`, `SecurityRepository`;
- `ApplicationSessionContext`, `UiSessionState`, `ProductionWorkspaceWindow`, `PanelHost`, `AppPanel`, `UiServiceRegistry`;
- every production mutation service/factory listed by the interface operation matrix;
- current free-form actor fields and audit-producing service paths;
- current role/session/security tests and source-route guard tests.

Implement the fixed reserved-role permission model consistently at shell/panel and authoritative service mutation boundaries. UI disabling is explanatory only; direct lower-privilege service calls must fail closed and write factual authorization-denial security events. Replace free-form audit actor authority with authenticated identity without creating a parallel audit identity.

Governing enforcement design: `doc/P20-S3-runtime-authorization.md`.

Completion gate:

- fixed permission matrix is implemented from current effective reserved roles with multi-role union;
- all production protected mutation routes use the central authorization guard;
- VIEWER cannot mutate durable business/accounting state even through direct service calls;
- MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT, and ADMIN boundaries match the adopted P20 contract;
- company/role switching immediately changes permissions without a stale cache;
- authenticated identity is the authoritative actor for protected audit writes;
- denial events are durable H2 `security_event` facts;
- JavaFX commands/actions reflect the same permissions and explain unavailable operations;
- Maven PR Tests and production JavaFX route compliance are green on the exact final head;
- owner desktop acceptance is complete.

## 7. Advancement rule

Execute only the active slice. Do not begin P20-S2 implementation until P20-S1 requirements are merged and current `main` is rescanned. Do not begin P20-S3 until P20-S2 is merged and authenticated session identity is authoritative.
